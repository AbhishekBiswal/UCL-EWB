		<p>Our mission as EWB-UCL is to remove barriers to development. There are many barriers to defeating poverty, but we think that the lack of access to engineering should not be one of them. We empower everyone in their own development journeys, with changes to education, with new opportunities, with improvements to technology and with inspirational leadership.
The initiative for EWB-UCL started in October 2008 with the initiative from Lionel Ward, a first year student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He organised an event where Andrew Lamb, Chief Executive of EWB UK gave a talk about EWB-UK and Paul Hellier, a new PhD student at UCL, shared his experience having been involved in a EWB branch leading the Outreach team before. During the event several people joined the society and organised a variety of events, including talks and video screenings, during the 2008-2009 academic year. A team of students completed the first project in Peru in the summer of 2009 (maybe link back to more info in the past project section?).</p></div>

<p>In 2009-2010 the society went from strength to strength, the society membership grew rapidly and we hosted events attended by many students and staff. Our talks included a visitor from RedR, several people from the EwB professional network, and three young female engineers from Arup who had come first out of about 100 candidates in their design for a school building in Uganda. One of them was a UCL Alumni and had studied with Nick Tyler. We were trying to start an exchange and mentoring relationship with the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology in Rwanda, which is one of the most upcoming engineering universities in that region. This was complicated by the political situation and other factors. A project was completed in Mozambique (link back). In 2010, the society also became affiliated to both the Union and Engineers Without Borders UK
During 2010-2011 the momentum continued, with 157 registered members with very active, efficient and passionate people and this led to having a wide range of events and a lot of successful achievements. We hosted our first International Development course, took part in the National Conference 2011, where we presented our society and our new initiatives were praised as leading examples of a growing society. We initiated the Outreach work, engaging schools, getting all the paperwork, etc. We organised a variety of fundraising events and managed to organise the Peru revisited 2011 project (link back) . We also organised socials with Imperial College and had our first paintballing activity. We also supported EWB-UK during the Big Bang Fair 2011 in Excel. We participated on a UBS fund your vision competition at UCL fundraising for our overseas projects and came first; we then went on to represent UCL in the finals competing against Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial. We came second to Imperial College who won with a similar project to ours.</p></div></div>

<p>The committee of 2011-12 was 16 strong with a number of focused, ambitious individuals who drove the society to an extremely successful year. We began the year with a presentation at the UCL engineering faculty Head of Departments meeting. The aim of this presentation was to expose EWB and all it had achieved for both the cause, and for the students involved, to the HoD’s, where they may have been ignorant of the societies existence up until this point. The presentation was received better than could have been expected and as a result the faculty committed to supporting the society both from a monetary and mentoring perspective. £16,000 pounds was granted to the society to fund the years activities as well as a plan to employ a full time member of staff to increase the societies capacity to grow. This pledge of support at the beginning of the year really expanded the possibilities for the society as is reflected in achievements of the society for this year. The year began with the intention of completing four overseas projects: Nepal, Brazil, Peru and Mozambique. UCL friends trust granted the society £4000 for their overseas projects (the maximum grant allocated by the trust). Un Raisers included a Live Music night and bake sales. The society was asked by EWB-UK to form one of the organisations five Bursary Panels which was initiated through funding from Barclays Capitol (a number of members of the society attended meetings with Barclays Capitol and EWB-UK in Canary Wharf during the development of this scheme). The panel met once for a round of project reviews in February.. The major events of the year were the societies second annual International Development Conference and hosting the EWB-UK national Research and Education Conference at which I was privileged enough to be invited to give one of the key note speeches. Outreach took off with their first two ventures into local schools to give a ‘Water for the World’ workshop (much of the year was spent obtaining all the proper documentation and training as well as making connections with local schools with the help of UCL VSU). The two Outreach officers also attended the EWB-UK National Outreach Conference in Cardiff, and two committee members also attended the EWB-UK National Conference in Birmingham.
During the 2012/13 academic year, we are seeking to expand and professionalise EWB UCL, developing a strategic plan for the next 5 years and reviewing our achievements since the conception of the society in 2008. We are striving to include more members from a diverse range of UCL departments, to develop our existing partnerships and to forge new ones.</p>
