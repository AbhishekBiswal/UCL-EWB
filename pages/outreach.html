			EWB Outreach is a great way for students to get involved and make a difference in their local community. As a member of the Outreach team you will be applying hands-on engineering skills when working with school children in less privileged areas of London. As an on-going project, with workshops at schools organised throughout the year, this is a great complement to the work  EWB does internationally. If you don’t have the opportunity of going abroad with EWB – this is a great chance for you!

			The programme involves organising and running engineering-related workshops for school children of different ages around the city. In the past we have been running a workshop called “Water for the World”, where the task is to build water filters. The children have to tackle issues such as budget deficits and lack of education, and we help them relate this to real-life situations in developing countries. This has been a great success – the kids have loved it and everyone has had loads of fun!
